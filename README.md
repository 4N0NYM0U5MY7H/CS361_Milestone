# How to run the program:
1.) The program will ask the user if they want to get the json information.
2.) Then the user types YES and then it will show that it is getting the data. Then print in the books.txt that its getting the request.
3.) Then it will get the information from the json file and then the microservice will send the information from the json file to the HTML file.
4.) Then the getJson.txt will print request received.
5.) All of the information will be printed in the html page called results.html

The results.html is the final product of the microservice. It will be in the same directory as the microservice.py will be in.
